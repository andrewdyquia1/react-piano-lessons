export const biography = 'I am Andrew Dyquiangco. I am a piano teacher who has been teaching for the past six years. I studied at California State University Long Beach and received a Bachelor degree in Music Performance. I have taught students for the Certificate of Merit and National Guild of Musicians programs. My goal for my students is for them to discover the joys of learning and producing music in a pain free way. I hope for them to develop their own music tastes, find motivation to learn to play the music they love, and to just enjoy the world of music making.'

        answer: "I am based in Orange. I can come drive as far as a ~20 mile radius from Orange. Other factors include time to travel and time of day of the lesson. If the lesson time asked is during peak rush hour and is about 20 miles, I probably can't accomodate that."
